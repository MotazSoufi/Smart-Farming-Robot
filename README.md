In this project, an embedded Linux system was designed to control a smart farming robot. The system includes a variety of components such as a Raspberry Pi, a linear actuator/stepper motor, a soil moisture sensor, a pump water tank, and a sprayer end. In addition, the agricultural land is managed by the robot, which is remotely operated through a user interface. The interface enables users to oversee the robotâ€™s operation and assess the level of soil moisture in designated region.
